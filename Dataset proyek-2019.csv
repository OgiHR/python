DI INDONESIA",2019,MULIA ARY MASHITOH,"This study analyzes the movement and asymmetry of rice and beef prices at
the producer and consumer level between regions in Indonesia. The data used in
this study is data on rice and beef prices at the producer and consumer level from
2010 to 2017. The method used in the analysis is the Error Correction Model
(ECM). The movement of rice and beef prices between regions in Indonesia
fluctuated throughout the period 2010-2017. The price of rice at the producer level
is more volatile than the price of rice at the consumer level. While the price of
beef at the consumer level is more volatile than the price of beef at the producer
level. Transmission of rice prices at the consumer level to prices at the producer
level occurs asymmetrically, both in the short term and in the long run. In
producer-consumer relations, the transmission of rice prices at the producer level
to prices at the consumer level occurs asymmetrically in the short term, but
symmetrically in the long run. While the transmission of beef prices at the
consumer level to prices at the producer level is symmetrical in both the short and
long term.","Price Asymmetry, Rice, Beef, ECM"

economy. The price conditions of red chili and shallot in Kramat Jati Central Market
fluctuated. The price fluctuation of red chili and shallot indicate a price risk. The
purpose of this study was to analyze the movements and risks of the prices of red
chili and shallot in the Kramat Jati Central Market. The study used secondary data
on prices of red chili and shallot for the period of January 2014 to December 2016.
This study used descriptive analysis, a coefficient of variation and variance using
the ARCH-GARCH model. The results showed that the prices of red chili and
shallot fluctuated. The factors that influence the price of red chili at the current time
period were the supply of red chili during the current period and the price of chili
in the previous period. While the risk of red chili prices for the current period was
influenced by the volatility of the price of red chili one day before and the price
variance of one and two days before. The factors that influence the price of shallot
for the current period was the prices of shallot in the previous period. While the risk
of shallot prices for the current period was affected by the volatility of shallot prices

transmission in the Indonesian and international markets. The data used in this study
is a SMP price (HS 040210) starting from January 2010 to January 2019. The
method used in this study is the Error Correction Model (ECM) method. The results
of the study show that overall, there is a mutually integrated relationship between
SMP prices in the Indonesian and international markets. The results show that short-
term price transmission in the Indonesian market and international markets (the
United States of Australia, Belgium, and New Zealand) occurs asymmetrically in
the short due to adjustment costs. Meanwhile, there is no asymmetric price
transmission in the long run. This shows that there is no market power by the
Indonesian exporting country.","Asymmetrical prices, ECM method, Skim Milk Powder’s Price"

grains in Bogor Regency is still below the West Java Province average price. This
price has not been able to create enough income for farmers to meet their
household needs. The purposes of this study are to: (1) Analyze the cost and

for the people to not depend on one type of staple food commodity. Changes in
income and food prices will determine the ability of real purchasing power of the
people which ultimately affects the diversity of the types of staple food purchased.
This paper analyzes the effect of income and food prices on the staple food
consumption diversification in Western and Eastern Regions of Indonesia during
the period 2013-2017. This study uses the econometrics model in the form of panel
data with Fixed Effect Model (FEM) approach. The results show that income can
increase the staple food consumption diversification in Eastern Regions of
Indonesia, but it can reduce the staple food consumption diversification in Western
Region of Indonesia. This is due to differences in food expenditure in each region.
Food prices affect the staple food consumption diversification in both regions.
Stable and affordable food prices can increase food access so that people are able
to buy food commodities to meet their needs.","FEM, food prices, income, staple food consumption diversification"

Indonesia in the form of droughts, decreasing rainfall and decreasing agricultural
production. The first objective of this study was to analyze the influence of El
Nino and other variables on inflation and the second objective in this study was to
analyze the impact of El Nino and other variables on poverty. The method used is
the static panel method. this study uses data from 25 provinces in Indonesia.
Monthly data period from 2008-2015.
The dependent variable in this study is inflation and the number of poor
people. while the independent variables are food commodities such as Prices of
chili, Onions, Rice, Soybeans, Corn, El Nino, Inflation and PDRB. El Nino and
the price of food comodities have a positive and significant effect on inflation.
Inflation have a positive and significant effect on the number of poor people,
while PDRB have a negative significantly effect the number of poor people.
Based on this research it can be suggested that the government as a
policy maker in repeating and accommodating the impact of El Nino with policies
on food price supervision. The government strengthens the provision of
supporting facilities and infrastructure for agriculture by means of good irrigation.

TRANSMISI VOLATILITAS HARGA BEBERAPA
KOMODITAS PANGAN DUNIA",2019,FATHIMAH SHOLIHAH,"The increasing global production of biofuels provides a new link between
crude oil and agricultural commodities. US and Indonesia are countries which have
been doing biofuels development. US used corn and Indonesia used palm oil as
feedstock of biofuels. Biofuels development leads increasing biofuels feedstock
demand. Unfortunately, this conditions gave impact on rising biofuels feedstock
prices and others agricultural commodities prices which has relationship with
biofuels feedstock, for instance meat chicken, rice, wheat and soybean.
The aims of this research are to analyze relationship between crude oil prices
and agricultural commodities prices through volatility pattern descriptions and
cointegration analysis, to analyze the impact of biofuels development which used
corn and palm oil on food prices through price transmission and price volatility
transmission; furthermore this research will compare the effect between corn and
palm oil to food prices. This paper will examine two types of transmission ; cross
commodity and spasial transmission. Using monthly data from 1960 to 2008, we
used some model to answer the purpose: ARCH GARCH model and Engle Granger
Cointegration test to examine relationship between crude oil prices and agricultural
commodities prices, VAR model identifies transmission in price while GARCH
BEKK model is used to identify transmission in volatility.
Based on the result, there are a relationship between crude oil and agricultural
prices. The relationship can be seen through similarity volatility pattern and
cointegration between them. Moreover, biofuels development give impact not only
increasing on biofuels feedstock prices but also on food prices. The volatility of
corn price is transmistted to five commodities: own past price, palm oil, rice,
soybean and wheat, but the volatility of palm oil is transmitted just to one
commodity, soybean. The findings of the study indicate that biofuels development
used corn as food commodity is more risk than used palm oil as plantation
commodity, then biofuels development does not give impact on domestic price in
Indonesia.","biofuels, GARCH BEKK, price transmission, price volatility
