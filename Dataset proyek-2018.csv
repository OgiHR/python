One of the factors that determines rice quality is its physical characteristics.
Bogor is one region in Indonesia which has a high rainfall, that the water content
of its rice is high and makes the rice’s quality lower. The purpose of this study is
to know the impact of rice physical characteristics on rice prices in Bogor. The
method used in this study is descriptive analysis method and hedonic price
analysis. Results showed that most rice in Bogor is categorized as Premium II
quality, according to its physical characteristics. Based on hedonic price analysis,
all independent variables used has a significant effect on rice prices. However,
only menir grain, broken grain, and ration of length to width variables that has
significant effects on rice prices in Bogor.","rice, hedonic price function, price, physical characteristics, quality"
"TRANSMISI DAN ASIMETRI HARGA BAWANG
MERAH DI INDONESIA",2018,MEI HARDIANTI UTARI,"Shallot is one of the commodities that given special attention of the
government, as an effort to anticipate inflation. In Indonesia, shallot cultivation is
done in a seasonal way, so there is an over supply that causes a decrease in the price
during the harvest season, while the price increases in the famine season. Price
fluctuations in horticultural commodities have more impact to farmer than trader,
they can provide more opportunities for traders to manipulate price information at
the farmer level and cause price asymmetry. The purpose of this study is to analyze
the transmission of shallot price in Indonesia used an Error Correction Models
(ECM) approach. This research used the daily data of shallot price at the producer,
central market, and consumer levels in 2017. The results of this study indicate there
is an asymmetry between producer and central market in the short run.","Asymmetry, ECM, Price Transmission, Shallot."

play an important role in the Indonesian economy. One of these roles can be seen
from the contribution of chili in the formation of national inflation rate. Prices
fluctuation in the marketing levels of chili will provide an opportunity for market
participants to manipulate prices. This can lead to the transmission of prices in the
marketing chain to be imperfect. Producer does not benefit from price increase at
the consumer level and the consumer does not benefit from the decline price in
producer price. The purposes of this study are to: (1) analyze price movement of
chilies at producer, wholesale market, and retail level in Indonesia, (2) analyze the
price asymmetric of chilies at producer, wholesale market, and retail level in
Indonesia. Secondary time series data daily 2017 which is the price of chilies was
used for the analysis. Source of data obtained from Kementerian Pertanian and
Info Pangan Jakarta. The research using a model Error Corection Model (ECM).
The results show that: (1) the price of chili change is faster at the producer level,
(2) asymmetric price of red chili and small chili occurs at the wholesale market

some of Indonesia's population, therefore, rice is used as an indicator of poverty.
The demand for rice is inelastic, hence the fluctuation of rice price becomes the
government's attention. The transmission of rice prices goes asymmetrically, thus
causing a high price disparity among agencies within the rice marketing chain.
This research aims to analyze the movement of rice prices at the level of
producers, wholesalers, and consumers, also analyze the asymmetry of rice prices
in Indonesia. This research uses secondary data as time series data, in the form of
medium and premium rice (1 January-31 December) daily data in 2017 while
employing Error Correction Model (ECM) method. The result of this research
reveals that based on the value of the coefficient variation (CV), producer price is
more fluctuated compared to the market price of the wholeseler and consumer.

long run for both types of rice is asymmetry.","Asymmetry Price, ECM, Rice"
"DAMPAK IMPOR TAPIOKA

component in tapioca production, cassava has a close relationship with tapioca. Cassava
price plays an important role in the lives of cassava farmers and its processing industry,
it also determines the competitiveness of Indonesia’s cassava and tapioca. Therefore,
cassava prices need to be observed. This study aims to analyze the factors that determines
Indonesia’s cassava prices and the impact of tapioca import policy on Indonesia’s cassava
price determination. The method Error Correction Model was used to identify which
variables have significant effects on the determination of Indonesia’s cassava prices.
Monthly time series data from January 2011 until December 2016 was used in this study.
Results showed that in the long-term, previous month’s cassava price, imported tapioca
price, tapioca import value, and exchange rate have significant effects on Indonesia’s
cassava prices. While in the short-term, variables that have significant effects on
Indonesia’s cassava prices are previous month’s cassava price, tapioca import value, and
domestic cassava production. Tapioca import volume does not have significant effects
on Indonesia’s cassava prices. Based on the results of this study, the right policies to be
applied are cassava’s production and productivity enhancement, which can be attained
through extensification and intensification programmes.","Error Correction Model, tapioca import, price determination, cassava"

variations and intensity of rainfall, so that it can affect the agricultural sector,
especially the food and horticulture crops sub-sector which is very vulnerable to
climate change. This research examines the impact of climate change on food and
horticulture prices such as rice, maize, soybean and red chili using the static panel
method. Cross section data focuses on the 10 most affected provinces of the
ENSO phenomenon, while time series data is used from 2011Q1 until 2016Q4.
The results show that El Nino significantly affects the increase of rice and

of chili contributes to large inflation of foodstuffs that occur in Indonesia. DKI
Jakarta Province is an area that does not produce chili. Meanwhile, the demand of
chile in DKI Jakarta is fulfilled by importing from other provinces mainly from
West Java Province, Central Java, and East Java. This indicates that there is a link
between the location on the price of chili in Java. Price of chili modeling in five
provinces in Java is intended to forecast the price of weekly chili not only related
to the previous time but also related to its surrounding provinces. The VARIMA
model is a dual variable time data forecasting data model. The model depends not
only on the lag of the variable itself but also influenced by other variables. Thus,
GSTARIMA model approach is data model development of time series with
multiple variables that include weighting location into the model. The results show
that the model produced to predict the price of chili using both models are VAR (3)
and GSTAR (3; 1) models. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values
generated on the VAR model (3) is smaller than the GSTAR model (3;1). The

The purpose of this study was to see whether the HET rice policy benefits on
improving rice milling in Purbalingga District. This study uses primary data in the
form of cost and acceptance of rice milling. The efficiency analysis is done by cost

Actually, by utilizing the price fluctuation, information about the factors, will be
