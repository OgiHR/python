"PENENTUAN HARGA OPSI EXCHANGE DENGAN
MENGGUNAKAN MODEL BLACK-SCHOLES",2021,ISNA NUR FAJRIAH,"Exchange option is an option to exchange one asset for another at maturity.
This option is simultaneously a call option on one asset and a put option on the
other asset. One of the methods that can be used to determine the option price is the
Black-Scholes model. This paper discusses derivation and illustration of the Black-
Scholes model to determine the price of an exchange option. Furthermore, the
illustration of the Black-Scholes model also discusses factors affecting the price of
exchange option, such as the current price of the first stock, the current price of the
second stock, the time to maturity, the volatility of the stock price, and the
correlation between the first stock price and the second stock price. Based on the
illustration, it can be concluded that the current price of the second stock, the time
to maturity, and the volatility of stock price are directly proportional to the price of
the exchange option, while the current price of the first stock and the correlation
between the first stock price and the second stock price are inversely proportional
to the price of the exchange option.","Black-Scholes model, exchange option, option price."
"ANALISIS VOLATILITAS HARGA BERAS DAN FAKTOR

INDONESIA PERIODE 2014-2020",2021,SOPI YATUN HASANAH,"Indonesia is one of the countries that is the third largest producer and
consumer of rice in the world. This is in line with Indonesian people who mostly
make rice as the main food ingredient. Rice is a food commodity that tends to be
volatile. This study aims to analyze the volatility of rice prices in Indonesia for the
2014-2020 period and analyze the factors that influence changes in rice prices in
Indonesia for the 2014-2020 period. The method used in this study is the ARCH-
GARCH model to determine the volatility of rice price and the VECM method to
determine the factors that influence changes in Indonesia rice prices. The results
show that Indonesia’s rice commodity is still volatile during the 2014-2020 period.
The factors that significantly influence changes in the price of indonesian rice in the short term are the variables of the Indonesian rice price itself
and inflation. Meanwhile, in the long term, variables that significantly affect
changes in Indonesian rice prices are inflation, interest rates, world rice prices and
exchange rates. The results of the IRF show that the shock of the factor variables
to changes in Indonesian rice prices varies between periods. FEVD results for the
next five years period all variables have a percentage contribution in influencing
changes in Indonesian rice prices.","ARCH-GARCH, Indonesian Rice Prices, VECM, Volatility"

variables, the COVID-19 pandemic as a dummy variable and the share price of
agribusiness companies as the dependent variable. The data used are secondary data
from 2015 to 2020 and analyzed by ECM (Error Correction Model). The results
shows that in the short term, only world oil prices and palm oil prices affect the
stock price performance of upstream group companies, while in the downstream
group, all variables including the COVID-19 pandemic doesn’t affect the
company's stock price performance. In the long term, all variables including the
COVID-19 pandemic affects the performance of the share price of companies in
the upstream group, while for the downstream group, only inflation, exchange rates,
world oil prices, crude oil prices, and the COVID-19 pandemic affects the

model. This model can be used when the assumptions are fulfilled. In fact, options
trading does not fulfill several assumptions so the Black-Scholes model cannot
provide an analytical solution for option prices. This is the reason for the need of
numerical methods to calculate European option prices. This study uses numerical
methods such as the Monte Carlo method which calculates option prices by
simulating stock prices and the finite difference method which performs
discretization on partial differential equations. This paper examines the
convergence for each method. Next, we examine the effect of several parameters
on the option price using the finite difference method. The expiration time of the
option and the option price has a different relationship for certain conditions and
the volatility of the stock price is directly proportional to the option price.","European option, finite difference method, Monte Carlo method, option"
"ANALISIS VOLATILITAS DAN FAKTOR-FAKTOR YANG
MEMENGARUHI PERUBAHAN HARGA JAGUNG
INDONESIA",2021,YOZI YUSANDRA,"Food is the main source of community needs. One of the food commodities
that play an important role in realizing self-sufficiency and national food security
is corn. The main problem with corn is the price volatility that has occurred over
the last few years. The volatility that occurs causes the price of corn to
experience uncertainty which can affect the demand and supply of corn in
Indonesia. Therefore, it is necessary to know the main problems causing the
volatility of corn prices that continue to occur in order to achieve self-sufficiency
and food security. The analysis period in this study is from January 2013 to
December 2020. The analytical method used in this study is the ARCH-GARCH
model to see the level of fluctuations in corn prices. Furthermore, the VECM
method is used to determine the factors that influence changes in Indonesian
corn prices. The results of the analysis show that Indonesia's corn commodity isstill volatile during the period research. This indicates that price stability has not
yet been achieved. Furthermore, using the VECM method shows that the world
corn price factor in the short term has a significant effect on changes in
Indonesian corn prices. Meanwhile, in the long term, factors that have a
significant effect on changes in Indonesian corn prices are world corn prices,
exchange rates, and inflation. The impact of factor variable shocks on changes in
Indonesian corn prices varies between periods and begins to stabilize after the
21st month. The variance contribution of each factor has a percentage that is
able to influence changes in Indonesian corn prices in the long term, so that the
volatility of Indonesian corn prices is influenced by the variables that have been
studied.","ARCH-GARCH, Indonesian Corn Prices, VECM, Volatility."

including large chilies consisting of red chilies and curly chilies and cayenne pepper
consisting of green cayenne pepper and red cayenne pepper. The demand for large
chilies and cayenne pepper is inelastic, so the price tends to be volatile. The volatile
price pattern causes the chili commodity to be included in the volatile food category.
This study is to determine the differences in both the price patterns of large chili
and cayenne pepper and the volatility of the two chili prices. The method that used
are ARIMA and ARCH-GARCH models. The results showed that the volatility that
occurred in these two commodities tended to be low and the price of cayenne pepper
had higher volatility with an ARCH coefficient of 0.833003 compared to the price
of large chili which had an ARCH coefficient of 0.479061. The prices of large
chilies and cayenne pepper are highly volatile on the November to February. The
high volatility was caused by extreme weather so that chili production decreased
while demand increased.","ARCH-GARCH, ARIMA, cayenne pepper, large chili, volatility"

bullish conditions, long strangle in neutral conditions, and short put ladder in
bearish conditions. In the strap and long strangle strategy, the maximum profit is
infinity with the maximum loss is the initial cost. In the short put ladder strategy,
the maximum profit is the sum of strike price that has been adjusted for the option
cost, while the maximum loss is the sum of higher strike price that has been
adjusted for the option cost. When the option is exercised, the final hedging

import price of garlic, the domestic price of garlic, gross domestic product,
national garlic consumption, domestic garlic production, and the exchange rate,
the demand for garlic imports is evaluated using a double logarithm model. The
exchange rate of the rupiah against the US dollar is used as an explanatory
variable. Garlic imports in Indonesia are increasing at a rate of 19.2 percent per
year on average. Variations in consumption have the greatest impact on
Indonesian garlic import demand, followed by changes in import pricing. Changes
in domestic prices and production have little effect on demand for Indonesian
garlic imports. The consequence is that demand for imported garlic will continue
to rise in lockstep with consumer demand. If there is no major increase in
production, garlic imports will continue to rise.","Garlic, Double log model, Import demand ."
