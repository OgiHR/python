PADA MASA PANDEMI COVID-19",2022,SYARIFA ASRIN,"The pandemic covid-19 has impacted global economy including Indonesia. In response to dealing with the spread of Covid-19 cases, Indonesian government has imposed social restrictions which directly impacts people’s economic activities including food sector. This study aims to analyze the transmission of rice prices from the producer level to the consumer level during the covid-19 pandemic. Price transmission describes the impact of changes in the price of an item at one market level on changes in the price of the item at another market level. The data used is daily time series data from March 2020 to March 2021. The data is analyzed using the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach. The VAR estimation results show that producer prices and consumer prices do not affect each other. The absence of price transmission between producers and consumers may indicate that government intervention to maintain rice prices during the Covid-19 pandemic has been effective.","covid-19, price transmission, rice, VAR"

ANALISIS VOLATILITAS HARGA KEDELAI DI INDONESIA,2022,ADELIA MARGARETA,"Soybean is the main food commodity besides rice and corn which functions as a source of vegetable protein for the Indonesian people. Fluctuations in price variance will cause price volatility and have an impact on the food processing industry, one of which is the tofu and tempeh industry, which is a small industry with limited capital.. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate the stability of soybean prices the government to minimize risks and uncertainties that will harm both soybean producers and consumers. This study aims to analyze the volatility of soybean prices, both local consumer and producer level soybeans and imported soybeans, as well as tofu and tempeh prices in Indonesia. The study uses monthly time series data from January 2010 to December 2021. The method used is ARCHGARCH to calculate the volatility of soybean price variables, both local soybeans at consumer and producer levels and imported soybeans, as well as prices of tofu and tempeh in Indonesia. The results showed that local soybean consumer prices were more volatile than imported soybean prices. Soybean prices at the producer level and tempeh prices show a low level of volatility, while tofu prices show a high level of volatility which will have a major influence on market dynamics.","ARCH-GARCH model, Indonesian soybean price, Volatility"

BERAS PROVINSI DI PULAU JAWA",2022,"RISKA TRI SUSANTI","The Covid-19 pandemic first appeared in the city of Wuhan and entered Indonesia in early 2020 and spread very rapidly, especially on the island of Java. The Covid19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in Gross Domestic Product in several sectors in Indonesia, but data from BPS states that GDP growth in the agricultural sector from 2020 to 2021 grows consistently and positively. Growth in the agricultural sector occurred in several agricultural sub-sectors including rice food crops. Rice is a strategic food commodity of its availability to protect national security and to maintaining stability in Indonesia. This study aims to estimate the level of fluctuations in provincial rice prices in Java before and during the Covid-19 pandemic and the factors that affect provincial rice prices in Java in 201fromto 2021 using the panel data method. The results showed that rice price fluctuations in Java Island Province reached its peak at there beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, but the next in quarter the fluctuations were lower due to a decline in public demand and purchasing power and the government's price stabilization policy. Rice prices in Java Island Province are influenced by international rice prices, per capita consumption, Government Purchase Prices, and Covid-19, while rice production has no effect on provincial rice prices in Java. In addition, in the short and long term, every increase in international rice prices, per capita consumption, HPP, and cases of Covid-19 will increase the price of rice while every increase in rice production will reduce the price of provincial rice in Java. Suggestions for government policy are the need for stabilizing rice prices by increasing rice production."," Covid-19, fluctuation, Java Island, panel data, provincial rice prices"

Based on the monitoring of the Strategic Food Price Information Center from May 2018 to May 2021 the price of red chili fluctuated in 34 provinces, one of which was West Java province. The quantity of chili supply and the amount of demand imbalance needed by consumers causes price fluctuated. This study aims to build a predictive modeling of the price of large and curly red chilies in West Java Province using the Long Short Term Memory method. The red chili price prediction model using LSTM has been successfully formed and is considered representative enough to predict prices in traditional markets and modern markets in West Java Province. The best prediction model for the price of large and curly red chilies in traditional markets obtained the smallest RMSE values on the test data of 2.57% and 2.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the best price prediction model in the modern market obtained the smallest RMSE values on the test data of 2.11% and 2.17%, respectively. Based on the RMSE value obtained, the model is better than the previous research method and shows that the variation in the value produced by a model is close to the variation in the actual value.","long short term memory, prediction model, price fluctuation, red chili"

PANDEMI COVID-19",2022,NONA MAGDALENA,"Shallots are one of the important vegetable commodities for the people of Indonesia because of their function as the main cooking spice so that the demand for shallots tends to increase. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the price of shallots increased. The increase in the price of shallots is thought to be due to an abnormal distribution (the existence of Large-Scale Social Restrictions/PSBB) and the delayed planting season since 2019. This study aims to analyze the transmission of shallot prices at the producer and consumer levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data used is daily time series data from March 2020 to March 2021. The analysis uses the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach. The results of the VECM estimation show that the price of shallots at the producer and consumer levels in the long run experiences one-way price transmission, where price changes that occur in consumers affect prices to producers. In the short term there is no price transmission. The existence of one-way price transmission in the long term and the absence of short-term price transmission between producers and consumers may indicate that shallot marketing institutions in Indonesia are inefficient during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Covid-19 Pandemic, Price Transmission, Shallots, VECM"

Demand for these commodities has an inelastic nature so prices tend to be volatile. This study aims to analyze the price volatility of shallots, red chilies, and cayenne peppers and analyze the influencing factors during the 2019-2020 period. The method used is coefficient of variation (CV) analysis, ARCH-GARCH, and VECM. The results of the research using CV analysis showed that the fluctuations of the three commodities were still within reasonable limits. Factors that affect changes in Indonesian shallot prices in the short term are only domestic shallot prices, while in the long term the factors influencing changes in Indonesian shallot prices are exchange rates, interest rates, and inflation. For red chili, the only influencing factor in the short term is inflation, while in the long term the factors that influence changes in the price of red chili are inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates. The results of the IRF show that the shock of the factor variables to changes in the prices of Indonesian shallots and red chilies varies between periods. The results of the FEVD for the next five years show that all variables have a contribution percentage in influencing changes in the prices of Indonesian shallots and red chilies.","ARCH-GARCH, Cayenne Pepper, Onion, Red Chili, Volatility"

Hedging using an option strategy can be a solution to reduce risk if facing bullish conditions in the future. This study uses three option strategies, namely long call, short combo, and vertical ratio call back spread. Based on the calculation results, the cost of the vertical ratio call back spread is the lowest in bearish conditions and the short combo in bullish conditions. In neutral conditions, the lowest cost is achieved when the option strategy is not carried out. The three option strategies have an infinite maximum profit if the spot price increases, while the maximum loss occurs at different conditions and values. The vertical ratio call back spread is more profitable in bearish conditions, while the short combo is more profitable in bullish conditions.","Arabica coffee, hedging, long call, short combo, vertical ratio call back spread"

Based on food source commodities that contributed to inflation or deflation in December 2020, broiler eggs are the commodity with the second largest share of inflation after red chili. Therefore, the stability of the price of purebred chicken eggs is very important, considering that the share of purebred chicken egg inflation is quite high based on food ingredients. This study aims to examine the effect of the price of broiler eggs and other determinants of regional inflation as well as to examine the spatial interaction of the variables of inflation determinants and the spillover effect of regional inflation. The research method used in this study is the Spatial Panel regression model. The results showed that the commodity prices of broiler eggs, MSME loans, and the covid pandemic had a negative and significant impact on regional inflation. Meanwhile, the UMP and foreign bank lending rates and mixed-consumption have a positive and significant impact on inflation. Then there is a positive and significant interaction of spatial effects in this study, but there is no spillover effect of inflation at the regional level. This is because the best model chosen in this study is the Spatial Error Model (SEM). The lag in SEM appears as an error component indicating that the lag can only be explained outside the model.","Chicken eggs, Inflation, Spillover effect, Spatial Error Model, Spatial panel regression"
