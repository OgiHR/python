PADA MASA PANDEMI COVID-19",2022,SYARIFA ASRIN,"The pandemic covid-19 has impacted global economy including Indonesia. In response to dealing with the spread of Covid-19 cases, Indonesian government has imposed social restrictions which directly impacts people’s economic activities including food sector. This study aims to analyze the transmission of rice prices from the producer level to the consumer level during the covid-19 pandemic. Price transmission describes the impact of changes in the price of an item at one market level on changes in the price of the item at another market level. The data used is daily time series data from March 2020 to March 2021. The data is analyzed using the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach. The VAR estimation results show that producer prices and consumer prices do not affect each other. The absence of price transmission between producers and consumers may indicate that government intervention to maintain rice prices during the Covid-19 pandemic has been effective.","covid-19, price transmission, rice, VAR"

ANALISIS VOLATILITAS HARGA KEDELAI DI INDONESIA,2022,ADELIA MARGARETA,"Soybean is the main food commodity besides rice and corn which functions as a source of vegetable protein for the Indonesian people. Fluctuations in price variance will cause price volatility and have an impact on the food processing industry, one of which is the tofu and tempeh industry, which is a small industry with limited capital.. Therefore, it is necessary to anticipate the stability of soybean prices the government to minimize risks and uncertainties that will harm both soybean producers and consumers. This study aims to analyze the volatility of soybean prices, both local consumer and producer level soybeans and imported soybeans, as well as tofu and tempeh prices in Indonesia. The study uses monthly time series data from January 2010 to December 2021. The method used is ARCHGARCH to calculate the volatility of soybean price variables, both local soybeans at consumer and producer levels and imported soybeans, as well as prices of tofu and tempeh in Indonesia. The results showed that local soybean consumer prices were more volatile than imported soybean prices. Soybean prices at the producer level and tempeh prices show a low level of volatility, while tofu prices show a high level of volatility which will have a major influence on market dynamics.","ARCH-GARCH model, Indonesian soybean price, Volatility"

BERAS PROVINSI DI PULAU JAWA",2022,"RISKA TRI SUSANTI","The Covid-19 pandemic first appeared in the city of Wuhan and entered Indonesia in early 2020 and spread very rapidly, especially on the island of Java. The Covid19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in Gross Domestic Product in several sectors in Indonesia, but data from BPS states that GDP growth in the agricultural sector from 2020 to 2021 grows consistently and positively. Growth in the agricultural sector occurred in several agricultural sub-sectors including rice food crops. Rice is a strategic food commodity of its availability to protect national security and to maintaining stability in Indonesia. This study aims to estimate the level of fluctuations in provincial rice prices in Java before and during the Covid-19 pandemic and the factors that affect provincial rice prices in Java in 201fromto 2021 using the panel data method. The results showed that rice price fluctuations in Java Island Province reached its peak at there beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, but the next in quarter the fluctuations were lower due to a decline in public demand and purchasing power and the government's price stabilization policy. Rice prices in Java Island Province are influenced by international rice prices, per capita consumption, Government Purchase Prices, and Covid-19, while rice production has no effect on provincial rice prices in Java. In addition, in the short and long term, every increase in international rice prices, per capita consumption, HPP, and cases of Covid-19 will increase the price of rice while every increase in rice production will reduce the price of provincial rice in Java. Suggestions for government policy are the need for stabilizing rice prices by increasing rice production."," Covid-19, fluctuation, Java Island, panel data, provincial rice prices"

Based on the monitoring of the Strategic Food Price Information Center from May 2018 to May 2021 the price of red chili fluctuated in 34 provinces, one of which was West Java province. The quantity of chili supply and the amount of demand imbalance needed by consumers causes price fluctuated. This study aims to build a predictive modeling of the price of large and curly red chilies in West Java Province using the Long Short Term Memory method. The red chili price prediction model using LSTM has been successfully formed and is considered representative enough to predict prices in traditional markets and modern markets in West Java Province. The best prediction model for the price of large and curly red chilies in traditional markets obtained the smallest RMSE values on the test data of 2.57% and 2.07%, respectively. Meanwhile, the best price prediction model in the modern market obtained the smallest RMSE values on the test data of 2.11% and 2.17%, respectively. Based on the RMSE value obtained, the model is better than the previous research method and shows that the variation in the value produced by a model is close to the variation in the actual value.","long short term memory, prediction model, price fluctuation, red chili"

PANDEMI COVID-19",2022,NONA MAGDALENA,"Shallots are one of the important vegetable commodities for the people of Indonesia because of their function as the main cooking spice so that the demand for shallots tends to increase. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the price of shallots increased. The increase in the price of shallots is thought to be due to an abnormal distribution (the existence of Large-Scale Social Restrictions/PSBB) and the delayed planting season since 2019. This study aims to analyze the transmission of shallot prices at the producer and consumer levels during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data used is daily time series data from March 2020 to March 2021. The analysis uses the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach. The results of the VECM estimation show that the price of shallots at the producer and consumer levels in the long run experiences one-way price transmission, where price changes that occur in consumers affect prices to producers. In the short term there is no price transmission. The existence of one-way price transmission in the long term and the absence of short-term price transmission between producers and consumers may indicate that shallot marketing institutions in Indonesia are inefficient during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Covid-19 Pandemic, Price Transmission, Shallots, VECM"

experience uncertainty which can affect the demand and supply of corn in
Indonesia. Therefore, it is necessary to know the main problems causing the
volatility of corn prices that continue to occur in order to achieve self-sufficiency
and food security. The analysis period in this study is from January 2013 to
December 2020. The analytical method used in this study is the ARCH-GARCH

method is used to determine the factors that influence changes in Indonesian
corn prices. The results of the analysis show that Indonesia's corn commodity isstill volatile during the period research. This indicates that price stability has not
yet been achieved. Furthermore, using the VECM method shows that the world
corn price factor in the short term has a significant effect on changes in
Indonesian corn prices. Meanwhile, in the long term, factors that have a
significant effect on changes in Indonesian corn prices are world corn prices,
exchange rates, and inflation. The impact of factor variable shocks on changes in
Indonesian corn prices varies between periods and begins to stabilize after the

the economic characteristics of an area. CPI statistics are needed up to the regencies/
municipalities level in this decentralization era. It’s like other important statistics
that are available up to the regencies/ municipalities level. On the other hand,
surveys to obtain CPI statistics are very limited so that CPI statistics are not
available in many regencies/ municipalities. The regencies/ municipalities that have
CPI statistics are incomplete in one province in all provinces in Indonesia.
There are two problems faced when the regency/municipality CPI needs to
be estimated. First is the resulted CPI statistics are only representative for urban
areas because in this area samples are available to estimate it. Second is the
existence of regencies/municipalities that do not have samples but their CPI
statistics need to be provided. The small area estimation (SAE) methods can be
applied as a solution to improve the accuracy of direct estimation results in area
samples and also obtain CPI statistics in non-sampled regencies/municipalities.
This study used the released data by BPS. The response variables were the
January 2018 consumer price index (CPI), obtained from the 2012 SBH and 2018
SHK. There were seven response variables according to the number of expenditure
groups. The auxiliary variables were obtained from the village potential data
collection in 2018 (PODES 2018). This PODES 2018 data was the result of
compilation of village administration data by BPS. There were 37 auxiliary
variables consisting of six aspects. The form data was the ratio of the existence of
villages in a regency/municipality based on these six aspects.
In this study, the regency/municipality CPI was estimated using the Fay-
Herriot model and the parameter were estimated by empirical best linear unbiased
predictor (EBLUP-FH). The results show that the EBLUP-FH can produce CPI
statistics at the sampled regencies/municipalities with better accuracy than direct
estimation in West Java Province. This is indicated by the value of the relative root
mean square error (RRMSE) of the EBLUP-FH CPI is smaller than the direct
estimator. The EBLUP-FH produced sample regency/municipality CPI statistics
with accuracy that was no better than direct estimation in Maluku Province. This
means that the EBLUP-FH estimator has not been able to improve the estimation
results directly with the sample size available in Maluku Province. Then, this study
improved the model using imputation for some observation with mean and

The EMD could be applied to a dataset eventhough that the data are nonlinear and nonstationary so it can work with the characteristics of unstable rice prices between seasons and years. The concept of ensemble is needed to optimalize the characteristic scale of the IMF by adding a series of white noise in the data. This research was carried out on the identification of the time series pattern of monthly and weekly rice price in Jakarta using Ensemble EMD. Our Ensemble EMD approach resulted three IMFs which have large contribution to volatility of monthly rice price. Those are IMFs whose mean periods of 1.1, 2.8 and 5.6 years respectively.
