"PERAMALAN HARGA KOMODITAS CABAI BESAR DI
PULAU JAWA DENGAN MODEL SPACE TIME TRANSFER
FUNCTION",2020,ANGGITA NURUL ANNISA,"Time series analysis is a statistical method commonly used for forecasting.
In addition to the time element, forecasting also needs to pay attention to the
influence of explanatory variables and spatial elements, so that the forecasting is
done can provide more accurate results. One time series analysis method that
considers the effect of explanatory variables and spatial elements is the Space Time
Transfer Function (STTF). Data that can be analyzed using the STTF model are
time series data that have spatial influence. The data used in this study are large
chili commodity price data and average rainfall data in each province in Java from
January 2017 to December 2019. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect
of average rainfall and spatial influence on the prices of large chili commodities
from time to time. The results of this study are the price of large chili commodities
in a particular month influenced by the average rainfall in the previous 3 months
until that month. The price of large chili commodities in one province is also
influenced by prices in other provinces directly adjacent to the province. These
happens because there is a large chili commodity distribution in each province.","forecasting, large chili commodity prices, space time transfer function,

DAN LA NINA",2020,NABILA SADELINA,"Natural phenomena such as prolonged drought, increased rainfall, fires and
floods that occurred in Indonesia, currently have a wide impact on all aspects of
human life. This is caused by climate change which has a significant impact. The
impact of climate change is an increase in extreme climate. Climate change makes
striking temperature anomalies such as the El Nino and La Nina phenomena or
commonly referred to as the ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) phenomenon.
The ENSO phenomenon causes fluctuations in rainfall, thus affecting the
agricultural sector, especially the plantation subsector. This study examines the
impact of climate change on coffee prices using the static data panel method. The
data used in this study in the form of 12 provinces affected from 2010 to 2017.
The ENSO phenomenon is shown through rainfall indicators. The results obtained
in this study are that El Nino has a significant effect in increasing coffee prices,
and is followed by other factors, namely the price of substitute goods (chocolate
prices), productivity and Real GDP.","coffee prices, El Nino, ENSO, La Nina, static panels"

"PENENTUAN HARGA OPSI LOOKBACK DENGAN
FLOATING STRIKE PRICE MENGGUNAKAN
METODE MONTE CARLO",2020,GHINA SALSABILA,"Lookback option is an option whose payoff depends on the maximum or
minimum of the asset price reached during the option period. The lookback option
is said to be a floating strike price if the value of the strike price is equal to the
stock price at maturity. The value of the lookback option is determined by the
Monte Carlo method, while the exact value is obtained from the largest simulation
value that the computer can compute. Based on the calculation results, the
resulting relative error value get smaller with the increasing number of
simulations performed. Therefore, the Monte Carlo method to calculate the price
of the lookback option with the floating strike price converges to the exact value.","ookback option, floating strike price, Monte Carlo method,

"NATURAL LANGUAGE-BASED FINANCIAL FORECASTING
OF THE RETURN OF JAKARTA COMPOSITE INDEX
USING SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION ON
FINANCIAL NEWS PAGES",2020,AUDHI APRILLIANT,"Volatility of return in stocks can be influenced by economic factors and
socio-economic sentiments that are available in the market. One of the data source
about socio-economic sentiments is financial news. The number of financial news
is increasing with along the development of technology and big data era. That
matter, especially the unstructured data, needs to be utilized in return of stock price
forecasting. The objective of study is to forecast the return of Jakarta composite
index (JCI) using natural language-based financial forecasting (NLFF). NLFF was
applied using predictors from features extraction of textual data, such as sentiment
and also other mathematics calculations. The forecasting of JCI was conducted by
using support vector regression (SVR) based on financial news data from Okezone,
Kompas, and Detik in 2019. In order to get optimum hyperparameters,
hyperparameters tuning was using walk-forward optimization. The best
hyperparameters were obtained by comparing the root mean square error (RMSE)
for each hyperparameters combinations. This study indicated that radial basic
function was the best kernel because it had the smallest RMSE with the highest
Pearson correlation compared to linear and polynomial. The JCI forecasting which
is using only financial news data did not produce good prediction.",hyperparameters tuning; JCI return; NLFF; support vector regression

DENGAN METODE EXTREME PROGRAMMING",2020,GILANG GUNAWAN,"Chili is a commodity that has a large part of inflation in Indonesia due to
fluctuating prices. The scarcity of chili, inefficient distribution patterns, and the
length of the supply chain are the triggers for this problem. The development of
technology is one solution that can be used to overcome these problems. The
purpose of this research is to develop a system that displays historical data to users
related to chili in each production center. This system was developed through a
descriptive analytics approach which is one part of business analytics. Through this
chili monitoring system per production center, the public can monitor developments
in the price, stock, production, and productivity of chili in every region in West

SAMUDERA CILACAP",2020,MOHD FADIL YUTARO,"Fishing vessels in Indonesia generally use wood material. Wood was chosen
because it is easy to work on, easy to design and recyclable. Wood has experienced
scarcity in nature and it is difficult to obtain due to excessive wood exploitation.
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (KKP) has conducted a conversion
program for the use of wooden ships to fiberglass ships through assistance for
fishermen. Fishermen are still reluctant to use fiberglass vessels because they
consider wooden vessels to have lower procurement costs. The purpose of this study
were to estimate and compare ship procurement costs, maintenance costs and
depreciation costs for wooden ships and fiberglass vessels. The analytical method
used was the calculation of the magnitude of the Gross Tonnage, the analysis of the
total production cost of shipbuilding and the analysis of depreciation costs. The
results showed a comparison of the total cost of making and selling prices that are
components of the cost of procurement of ships incurred for the manufacture of
three wooden ships and three fiberglass ships with a comparatively comparable size
obtained that the cost of procuring fiberglass vessels was cheaper than wooden
vessels. Comparison of maintenance costs and depreciation costs incurred per year
for three wooden ships and three fiberglass vessels that have varying sizes with a
relatively similar size ratio obtained by the cost of maintaining the ship and
depreciation costs incurred for ships made of fiberglass worth less than wooden
vessels.","depreciation costs, gross tonnage, maintenance costs, production costs,

"KAJIAN PENDUGAAN AREA KECIL UNTUK STATISTIK
INDEKS HARGA KONSUMEN KABUPATEN/KOTA DI
PROVINSI JAWA BARAT DAN MALUKU",2020,ANDI OKTA FENGKI,"Consumer price index statistics (CPI) are needed as one indicator to know
the economic characteristics of an area. CPI statistics are needed up to the regencies/
municipalities level in this decentralization era. It’s like other important statistics
that are available up to the regencies/ municipalities level. On the other hand,
surveys to obtain CPI statistics are very limited so that CPI statistics are not
available in many regencies/ municipalities. The regencies/ municipalities that have
CPI statistics are incomplete in one province in all provinces in Indonesia.
There are two problems faced when the regency/municipality CPI needs to
be estimated. First is the resulted CPI statistics are only representative for urban
areas because in this area samples are available to estimate it. Second is the
existence of regencies/municipalities that do not have samples but their CPI
statistics need to be provided. The small area estimation (SAE) methods can be
applied as a solution to improve the accuracy of direct estimation results in area
samples and also obtain CPI statistics in non-sampled regencies/municipalities.
This study used the released data by BPS. The response variables were the
January 2018 consumer price index (CPI), obtained from the 2012 SBH and 2018
SHK. There were seven response variables according to the number of expenditure
groups. The auxiliary variables were obtained from the village potential data
collection in 2018 (PODES 2018). This PODES 2018 data was the result of
compilation of village administration data by BPS. There were 37 auxiliary
variables consisting of six aspects. The form data was the ratio of the existence of
villages in a regency/municipality based on these six aspects.
In this study, the regency/municipality CPI was estimated using the Fay-
Herriot model and the parameter were estimated by empirical best linear unbiased
predictor (EBLUP-FH). The results show that the EBLUP-FH can produce CPI
statistics at the sampled regencies/municipalities with better accuracy than direct
estimation in West Java Province. This is indicated by the value of the relative root
mean square error (RRMSE) of the EBLUP-FH CPI is smaller than the direct
estimator. The EBLUP-FH produced sample regency/municipality CPI statistics
with accuracy that was no better than direct estimation in Maluku Province. This
means that the EBLUP-FH estimator has not been able to improve the estimation
results directly with the sample size available in Maluku Province. Then, this study
improved the model using imputation for some observation with mean and
regression of CPI statistics, so the better EBLUP-FH estimator was obtained. The
EBLUP-FH can also produce non-sampled regency/municipality CPI statistics with
good result.","consumer price index, EBLUP, Fay-Herriot model, small area
