The purpose of this research identify factors that affect soybean price and to analyze the pattern of domestic soybean price dynamic and transmission. The method used in this research is VAR/VECM. The data used is the monthly time series January 2000–November 2012. Shocks of the domestic price of soybean variable, international price of soybean variable, fuel price (gasoline industry) variable, and the GDP variable that affect of rising price of domestic soybean, but based on VECM testing the GDP does not affect significantly both in the short or long term. Shocks of the consumption variable, imports variable, production variable, exchange rates variable, and inflation variable result that affect of domestic soybeans price decrease, but based on VECM testing inflation does not affect significantly both in the short or long term.

The objectives of this research were to analyze the effect of production factors on production risks which were faced by tomato farmers in Gekbrong, and to analyze the level of price risk which were faced by tomato farmers in Gekbrong. This research used Just and Pope’s production function model to analyze the effect of production factors on production risks. Value of variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation were used to calculate the level of price risk. Based on calculations, the manure and potassium fertilizer were the risk inducing factors. While nitrogen fertilizer, phosphor fertilizer, liquid insecticides, leaf fertilizer, fungicide, and dry season were the risk reducing factors.

DEKOMPOSISI DERET WAKTU SECARA ENSEMBLE",2013,CASIA NURSYIFA,"The price of rice is one of the important indicator to determine the availability of rice. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (Ensemble EMD) is an alternative approach to analyze rice price fluctuation behavior through the process decomposition into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and the residual. The EMD could be applied to a dataset eventhough that the data are nonlinear and nonstationary so it can work with the characteristics of unstable rice prices between seasons and years. The concept of ensemble is needed to optimalize the characteristic scale of the IMF by adding a series of white noise in the data. This research was carried out on the identification of the time series pattern of monthly and weekly rice price in Jakarta using Ensemble EMD. Our Ensemble EMD approach resulted three IMFs which have large contribution to volatility of monthly rice price. Those are IMFs whose mean periods of 1.1, 2.8 and 5.6 years respectively. Meanwhile, from the weekly dataset, Ensemble EMD revealed three high contribution IMFs, whose mean period of 0.5, 1.0, and 3.4 years. Trend component contributes dominantly to the price level change. It could be seen by its contribution as long as 92.40% for monthly data and 96.34% for weekly data. Furthermore, the reconstruction of fine-to-coarse for weekly price data shows that all IMFs produced by decomposition weekly rice price are included in the high frequency component. It indicates that the imbalance of supply and demand market and the weather factor still affect the stability of rice prices in Jakarta.","empirical mode decomposition, ensemble, rice prices"

The aims of this research were to analyze the effects of the increasing soybean price on business performance in terms of cost structure, revenue, profit, and efforts to deal with adjustments made under these conditions. This research was conducted from December 2012 to Februari 2013. This research used primary data from direct interviews with respondents and secondary data from relevant institutions and literature. The analysis tools used are quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results indicated that an increase in soybean prices affected rising of the total cost significantly because 70 percent of the cost was used for the purchase of soybeans. The condition led to decrease the amount of profit earned. Based on the comparison of the cost structure of the three production-scale showed there was a trend that an increasing of business scale will decrease the cost per kg of soybeans. It is concluded that an adjustment has to be undertaken in order to get high profit by reducing the size and increasing the price of tempeh.","soybean, tempeh, cost, effort"
